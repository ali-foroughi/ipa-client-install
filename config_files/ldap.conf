# File modified by ipa-client-install

# We do not want to break your existing configuration, hence:
#   URI, BASE, TLS_CACERT and SASL_MECH
#   have been added if they were not set.
#   In case any of them were set, a comment has been inserted and
#   "# CONF_NAME modified by IPA" added to the line above.
# To use IPA server with openLDAP tools, please comment out your
# existing configuration for these options and uncomment the
# corresponding lines generated by IPA.
